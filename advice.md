Need to stay slow

take a water bottle
stop and take breaths
slow yourself down
use the water to stop 

be up front at the beginning
be transparent
say you're doing this for the first time
say you're nervous

be more explicit that the story in order to explain the problem
remind people of this as you go through the story
especially at the critical moments

as you build out the "lessons" part of the talk
it will be more clear what the important moments were
in the story

about 3 slides per minute
90 for 30 mins
120 for 40 mins
Keynote pointers

o rder a clicker - Logitech Presenter Pro 800 or something

figure out what the clever phrases are
and remember them as signposts

when talking about old company
start out by saying "this is not the situation any more"
just this is where i started

good phrases
"lack of general adequacy"

"they weren't fat, they were pregnant"

so good it's a
word slide: "developers as second-class citizens, users as a despised underclass.."
former boss: "pretty solid"

come back to empathy for past-ASDF
a public apology to ASDF

why didn't he just read the docs?
well to be fair, it was 5 years earlier when he started--
there was a lot less on the internet

a big takeaway:
get comfortable with saying no
having an exit strategy

in the last section, condense the parts about me
make the ending less I-focused. the last few sentences are fantastic.

imagees
start by using google and flickr
look for CC images
email and ask for permission - but you might not hear back

get a pack of credits for
depositphotos
medium size is good enough

how to choose the content of the image
google the literal meaning
and then jump off on tangents, possibly from weird search results

make placeholder slides
slides that have big points on them that you come back to later for images

use reverse image search to get source for it

find an image, but it's too small
if you can get it to 3/4 size then you can scale up
captions are great for keeping an image smalle

old stuff is great -- free and beautiful
