Where does joy come from?

I promised in the abstract that there was a way to find joy by letting go
of anger and fear in our work? Where does that joy come from? What is it?

Is joy...
* getting lost in the moment, working on our code without concern?
* our natural state, what's left when you remove anger and fear?

How do we find joy? This [article](http://www.wildmind.org/blogs/on-practice/five-ways-to-increase-your-joy)
suggests:
* Smiling, to help our brains be receptive to the positive,
  since they are predisposed to see the negative
* Communicating concrete appreciation
* Using kindness; practicing 'loving gaze' and 'loving touch'
* Feeling loved
* Noticing the positive

These items overlap, but there is a central idea that receiving, appreciating,
and practicing kindness can help us to feel better.

It's an ongoing choice to engage this way. We can take up this choice and
abandon it at any time. We should endeavor to be aware of the choice we're
making. If we know *that* we are choosing, we can see *what* we are choosing
and we can see whether that choice will suit us.
