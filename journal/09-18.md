I need to go find this study.

So, I'm sure you're all thinking, ok this sounds ridiculous. Code is just 1s
and 0s. It doesn't have feelings. You can't have compassion for it. Yeah,
you're right. But what is code, anyway?

I work remotely now, and I'm often most constructive at a coworking space where
I rent a reserved desk and often don't talk to anyone all day. I spend all day
by myself, with the legacy code. I spend all day with past me and a past version
of my boss and a past version of a developer whom I never met.

I spend all day with our customer support representative, who explains our
product to existing and potential clients and listens patiently if they
criticize it. Well, I don't spend the day with her, but I spend all day
with an artifact that she represents, sells, and sometimes has to apologize
for.

I'm not a people person. Probably you aren't either. Just going out on a limb
here, but there's probably a reason why you prefer to spend all day with code.
Wouldn't you rather spend your day calm and happy instead of angry and afraid?
It's your choice.

Maybe the difficult question isn't why, but how: how to remain compassionate
when working with legacy code.
