Some really good ideas in these journal entries.

Plan:
1. Reread journals
2. Write another outline, without looking at existing outline.
3. Flesh out with:
   * Headings for Story and all other major points
   * Subheadings for story milemarkers and minor points
   * Want to see
     - 4-5 major points (including Story)
     - 3-5 minor points for each
     - 3-5 items for each minor point
