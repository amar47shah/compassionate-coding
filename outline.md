Story
* ASDF
* Story as written in Pitch
* Examples of bad legacy code I inherited

Questions:
* How to stop deflecting and instead deliver value?
* How to stop being angry (or scared) and instead feel satisfied, happy, and at-ease?

Code as Partner
* Code that came to me as it was, though I couldn't recognize why it was that way
* Your partner has faults. You do too. They're not the same faults.
  - different coders have different strengths
  - We tend to think of skill development as a linear metric.
    - Coder A spends X years applying consistent effort to certain skills
    - Coder B spends Y years applying same degree of consistent effort
        to same skills
    - If Y > X, then Coder B should be better skilled than Coder A, right?
    - Clearly this is wrong
    - nowadays, software engineering skills comprise a highly dimensional space
      cf. Michael O Church, why programmers can't make money

Code as Child
* Beatrix
  - Like me: high degree of focus, sometimes timid, loves pizza, etc.
  - Here she is petting a snake. WTF.
* Code that I wrote completely, but which makes me say, "Who are you?"
  - minix iShell - WTF!!!
  - but here are the challenges I wrote it against.

Role of Compassion

What is Code?
* communication
* the artifact of what you do most of the day, most days
* the focus of your attention
* the proxy for your relationships
  - practice Humane Development!

So what can you do?
* contrast mindsets of "Hurting Code for Fun and Profit" and "Therapeutic Refactoring"
