Story
* ASDF
* Story as written in Pitch
* Examples of bad legacy code I inherited

Questions:
* How to stop deflecting and instead deliver value?
* How to stop being angry (or scared) and instead feel satisfied, happy, and at-ease?

Code as Partner
* Code that came to me as it was, though I couldn't recognize why it was that way
* Your partner has faults. You do too. They're not the same faults.
  - different coders have different strengths
  - We tend to think of skill development as a linear metric.
    - Coder A spends X years applying consistent effort to certain skills
    - Coder B spends Y years applying same degree of consistent effort
        to same skills
    - If Y > X, then Coder B should be better skilled than Coder A, right?
    - Clearly this is wrong
    - nowadays, software engineering skills comprise a highly dimensional space
      cf. Michael O Church, why programmers can't make money

Code as Child
* Beatrix
  - Like me: high degree of focus, sometimes timid, loves pizza, etc.
  - Here she is petting a snake. WTF.
* Code that I wrote completely, but which makes me say, "Who are you?"
  - minix iShell - WTF!!!
  - but here are the challenges I wrote it against.

Role of Compassion

What is Code?
* communication
* the artifact of what you do most of the day, most days
* the focus of your attention
* the proxy for your relationships
  - practice Humane Development!

So what can you do?
* look on the bright side--why isn't legacy code so bad?
  - Code is in production
    What you do matters
    You can get immediate feedback
    You will learn more
  - Code is developed
    You have something to sculpt
    You have examples, good and bad
    Codebase is large, complexity is high,
    because it is legacy code, complesity of small units may be very high
    You will learn more
  - Something I wish I paid more attention to:
    I enjoyed working on that legacy project far more than I let on.
    You think that's weird? I don't think so, or at least I don't
    think it's weird for people in this room.
    "Hurting Code for Fun and Profit" - this isn't violence, it's making this fun.
    "Therapeutic Refactoring"
* see clearly -- look through harmful emotions to the correct reality
  what REALLY makes legacy code projects intolerable?
  - hint: it's not the code
  - it's culture
      how do others in your organization react when
      - estimates go over
      - regressions occur
      if the reaction is blame (even of your predecessor)
        that's a red flag.
      need continuing reevaluation:
      - is this culture toxic?
      - can I change it?
        whether to stay and try change the culture is entirely up to you.
        depends on what you feel you can/must/should do. Entirely personal
      - what's my exit plan? -- doesn't have to be immediate
        - determine your constraints and work with them
