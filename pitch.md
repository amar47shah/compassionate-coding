Next month, I'm doing a talk called
*Working **Compassionately** with Legacy Code*.

story:

At my old job, I inherited a production codebase of 70,000 lines,
overzealously cut-and-pasted and brazenly untested.

---

I loved to complain about this code.

"The developer is long gone. He's the big CTO at Acme Megabucks,
you know the one that never called me back about my cover letter?"

I relished my hatred for the coder who went before me.

How could he leave me in this mess?
Did he have no pride? Was he completely without honor?

I wanted to scream from the rooftops that he was a phony. I wanted
revenge for what he did to me.

In the middle of this, I had a job to do.

---

I had to repay five years of accumulated technical debt.

I had to patch up gaping security holes before anyone else found them.

I had to upgrade from end-of-life versions of my codebase's language
and MVC framework.

Remember how I said there were no automated tests? I was terrified.
This was a system that my company depended on every day, and I was
the only one in the whole freaking building who knew it could come
apart at any moment.

---

I was out of my depth, but I put on a brave face. I ordered copies of
Martin Fowler's *Refactoring* and Michael Feathers' *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*. I worked slavishly, nights and weekends, hacking,
squeezing, extracting, injecting. I was a battlefield medic, slashing
limbs and yanking out shrapnel. I told my non-technical friends that
every day at work was like prodding a sick man through a desert.

"No, that's enough water for now. No, you can't like down! DO YOU WANT TO DIE?!"

---

I thought we'd never make it, but things began to turn around.

We shed our heavy coats, and stripped down, to a predictable set of
seven controller methods.

We wrapped our parched throats in a sheltering, though spartan,
service layer.

Over the desolate horizon, we glimpsed the first flickers of green--
a few, then rows upon rows, a veritable forest of passing tests.
We jumped for joy and fell to our knees in an embrace,
my partner and I
this legacy codebase and I.

---

In our journeys every day, our legacy systems are our partners.
They need us, but we also need them. Without their glaring imperfections,
what would we do all day? Why would we get up in the morning?
Healing our systems is our day's work. Their inscrutable bugs,
harebrained UIs, and misguided architectures aren't booby traps
left by a malevolent predecessor.

No. These scars are *relics of solutions* that we--
our systems and ourselves--
have outgrown together,

What would software development be like if we could set aside our
anger and our terror, to practice compassion for our code?

---

You’ll never stop working with code that’s hard to figure out or difficult to change.

Code comes to you as it is, not as you wish it were.
It has a history that you’ll never fully know.
It is wild, unruly, and fiercely self-sovereign.
But this code, this stubborn creature, is entrusted to you.
Let go of your anger at the developer who wrote it.
Let go of the terror of being blamed for its unforeseeable regressions.

---

Working with legacy code can be fun.

Come to the talk next month, and find out why.
